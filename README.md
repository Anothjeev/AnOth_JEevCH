## Kampa
On the way from Charles Bridge over Na Kampe Square, at the end of it, a view opens up to a small park, which, however, provides a large amount of pleasure, whether it is body or soul, on a relatively small area of ​​less than three hectares.

The park is divided by two main axes in a north-south direction: one runs along the Vltava, the other along the Čertovka and both are planted mature trees - horse chestnuts, maples and other specimens,

On the "Vltava" side it is possible to visit the Kampa Museum , otherwise also Sova's mills, where in the 15th century the mills were actually operated by Václav Sova from Liboslav and four hundred years later they were taken over, rebuilt and further operated by the famous bakery family Odkolků.
Today, the Museum of Modern Art is housed in a modernized building, with one of the most prominent Czech modernists of the 20th century, the painter František Kupka , having a permanent exhibition here .

In the same building it is possible to visit a restaurant and cafe overlooking the Vltava and the opposite bank.

A few steps further, especially for mothers with small children , there is the Kampa Community and Mother Center and a playground with many attractions, which is open from April to the end of October from 8 am to 7 pm, from November to the end of March from 8 am to 5 pm A public toilet is also built under the playground.

A few meters further, it is possible to taste the fish specialties of the Fishing Club , which operates a restaurant here, and walk to Vítězné Street on the Smíchov side. Or turn in the opposite direction and walk sideways along an artificial riverbed called Čertovka, but originally named Rožmberská strouha after the owner of the local lands Vilém of Rožmberk. The current name is derived from the house U Sedmi čertů.

Čertovka drives a large wooden wheel as a reminder of the local Huť mill and the fact that Kampa was created by merging several originally mill gardens, which were established together with mills, which were built here from the 15th century as one of the first local buildings.
At the spinning wheel, you can walk across the footbridge to the smaller Mlýnská café or walk a few meters over the bridge to Nosticov's Garden, where the Nablízko theater ensemble operates in the building of the Little Nostic Theater in the building of the same name.

By slowly returning back to Na Kampe Square along Čertovka you can reach the so-called Werich House, ie a house where several prominent personalities took turns living: the first was Josef Dobrovský, to whom Count Nostic donated the house, in front of the house is also a monument to Dobrovsky prof. Tomas Seidan.

During the First Republic, academician Zdeněk Wirth lived here, among others the author of the publication Disappeared Prague, mapping the history of Prague and places or objects that gradually ceased to exist for various reasons, especially for construction. Its bust is installed on the house, as well as other inhabitants in the order, which was Jan Werich, according to which the house is finally popularly called. At the same time as Werich, however, the poet Vladimír Holan also lived one floor below.

At present, the house has been empty for several years and the possibility of its further use is being sought.
The park, which was adapted to its current landscape form in 1947–1948, hosts various theatrical or artistic events, such as an open-air gallery, which exhibits non-weather works, and lawns are widely used for picnics and benches for rest.

### history

The origin of the name Kampa is not very clear, it comes either from the word campus or field, plain, or from the word zakampí - a shady place. Maybe also according to the owner of one of the houses, Tychon Gansgeb from Kamp.

However, before the first construction began here in the 15th century, there was an open space on which gardens were created and the first mention of which appeared in 1169 in the founding document of the church of the Maltese Order. Its height gradually increased as sediments and deposits from Malá Strana and Hradčany settled here, and it was not until the beginning of the 17th century that the banks were clearly formed.

However, there were already mills here, to which the land belonged - mill gardens, which were later transformed into aristocratic gardens. And so you can meet names like Michnovská or Nosticovská zahrada, Odkolkovská (at the Kampa weir), which is followed by the Kaiserštejnská garden, which wound around the Kaiserštejn, now Liechtenstein, palace.
In 1941, the dividing walls were removed from these once Baroque, but already neglected, lands, creating one large area, which was modified seven years later in a freely landscaping style to its current form.

Not only the park, but also the adjacent square in the immediate vicinity of Charles Bridge is one of the most famous complexes, simply called Kampa, which is famous, among other things, for the fact that many prominent cultural figures lived here and the inhabitants of Kampa formed a distinctive old settlement community.

The place was also famous in pre-November times, when people protesting against the communist regime met secretly in the neighboring Grand Priory Square by the so-called Lennon Wall (a wall with a portrait of John Lennon). These meetings were closely monitored by the secret police and participants were often persecuted.

## Kinsky Garden
In addition to landscaping, which included demanding landscaping and varied planting of mixtures of mostly domestic, but also foreign, woody plants, he had a summer house built in the Empire style and built a complex waterworks, a total of 380 meters long gallery, thanks to which water could be supplied as a villa. , as well as the garden, and also got to two ornamental lakes with a waterfall.

From the originally private garden, after the purchase of the areas of the municipalities of Smíchov and the city of Prague in 1901, the garden became publicly accessible, and it was planned to build ethnographic orchards in it. Due to the financial demands, the big plans were abandoned and in the end this idea was implemented in a much more modest design.  

The ethnographic collections of the National Museum were placed in the villa and the garden was gradually supplemented with several folk artifacts: a wooden bell tower from Dolní Bojanovice and Baroque martyrdoms. A monument to the actress Hana Kvapilová was also erected here.

A rarity is the Orthodox wooden church of St. Michal, transported in 1929, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the annexation of Subcarpathian Russia, from Medvědovce near Mukachevo.

The summer house, now called according to the Musaion collections , and the café can still be visited today. His collections include examples of folk costumes, tools, but also examples of customs and traditions, in addition to the permanent exhibition, there are also current exhibitions, concerts of folk music or demonstrations of crafts and customs.

### history
The original vineyards were located here sometime in the 12th century. After the Hussite conquests, they were destroyed, then restored and lasted until the Thirty Years' War. Around 1730, the land belonged to the court of Maria Anna Libštejnská of Kolovrat, but gradually it was not deserted and it was popularly called the Vrabcovna.

In 1828, they were bought by Růžena Kinská, the mother of Prince Rudolf, who in the same year began building a magnificent garden designed by František Höhnel and building a summer house according to the architect Jindřich Koch. The construction of the magnificent building with Ionic columns and a triangular tympanum, a garden with ten greenhouses for tropical plants, other buildings and a water gallery took a total of eight years, when in 1836 the prince died. The whole work was completed by his widowed wife Vilemín with the help of Bedřich Wünscher, Höhnel's successor as economic director. Despite the fact that the garden was not open to the public, those interested had the opportunity to visit it for tickets that were issued in the Kinský Palace on the Old Town Square.

From the last owner Ferdinand Kinský, the garden and the villa and accessories were bought by the village of Smíchov and Prague, which made it accessible to the public. The extension of Holečkova Street at the lower edge of the garden significantly affected the space and thus disrupted the compositional balance of the entire park.

In 1986, the summer house was closed and reconstructed due to emergency reasons. It was reopened in 2005 and serves as an Ethnographic Museum. The garden is still partly undergoing renovation work.
